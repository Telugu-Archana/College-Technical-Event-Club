                <span>
                    A debate is a discussion or structured contest about an issue or a resolution. A formal debate
                    involves two sides: one supporting a resolution and one opposing it. Such a debate is bound by
                    rules previously agreed upon. Debates may be judged in order to declare a winning side.
